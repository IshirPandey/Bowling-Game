Welcome to the Bowling Game repository! This project is a 3D bowling game developed using C# in Unity. It aims to provide an engaging and fun bowling experience with realistic physics and intuitive controls.

Overview-
The Bowling Game project is designed to simulate the experience of playing bowling with realistic graphics and physics. The game includes features like strike and spare scoring, various ball types, and interactive lanes. It serves as both an enjoyable game and a practical example of using Unity and C# for game development.

Motivation-
Bowling is a popular sport that combines skill and strategy, making it a great choice for a game project. By developing this game, we aim to showcase how Unity can be used to create engaging simulations with interactive elements and realistic gameplay. This project also serves as an excellent opportunity to explore game mechanics, physics simulations, and user interface design in Unity.

Features-
Realistic Physics: Accurate simulation of bowling ball dynamics, including spin, bounce, and collision.
Scoring System: Automatic calculation and display of scores for strikes, spares, and other outcomes.
User Controls: Simple controls for aiming, rolling the ball, and adjusting power.
Sound Effects: Realistic sound effects for strikes, ball rolls, and pin collisions.
Leaderboard: Track and display high scores (optional).

Usage-
Playing the Game-
Start the Game: Launch the game from Unity or the built executable file.
Play Bowling: Use the controls to aim, adjust power, and roll the ball to knock down pins.
View Scores: After each frame, view the score and stats on the scoreboard.

Controls-
Aim: Use the mouse or right joystick to aim the bowling ball.
Adjust Power: Slide the power bar to set the strength of the throw.
Roll the Ball: Click or press the roll button to release the ball.
Reset: Use the reset button to restart the game or return to the main menu.
